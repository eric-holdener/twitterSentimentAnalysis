# twitterSentimentAnalysis
This is my first attempt at a larger personal project. The idea is to scrape n amounts of tweets on x keyword and, utilizing a classification dataset, use Naive Bayes to perform
sentiment analysis on the data. Then, I will create a gui to display sentiment visually for the end user. 
Data for classification can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
